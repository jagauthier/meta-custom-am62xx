# For the un-initiated:
# The actual URL you'd use with a git clone for example would be:
# https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot.git/
# However, in the context of OE, we have to explicitly split things up:
# a) we want it to use git fetcher - hence git:// prefix in GIT_URI (if we
#  used https here, we'd endup attempting wget instead of git)
# b) and we want git fetcher to use https protocol, hence GIT_PROTOCOL as https
